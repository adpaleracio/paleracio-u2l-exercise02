Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. Create a repository with the format <filename>.github.io
2. On Settings, go to Pages on the sidebar. Under Build and Deployment and under Branch, select the branch and folder, then save.
3. For html files, push your html file with the name "index.html" onto the repository.
4. To see the site link, go to Settings then Pages again. The link should be available there, though it may take a while.

Key takeaways from this exercise:
- Although I have already used flexbox in my previous HTML/CSS projects, this is the first project where I truly understood how it works. I learned that a flex layout consists of a container, and it is where the flex items are found. I also learned that justify-content and align-items are different; justify-content is for the alignment along the main (x) axis, while align-items is for along the cross (y) axis. I will make sure to utilize this newly gained knowledge in my future HTML/CSS projects.\


P.S. The "View my project" links are dummy links only because there are missing files in my previous projects. The screenshots I included are from the functional portion of the website. The Instagram link also doesn't work because I don't have an account.
